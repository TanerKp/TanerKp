### Computer Science Student & Full Stack Developer
<p>As a computer science student and full stack developer, I've been on a journey of self-discovery and learning since I was 17. It all began when I picked up a book on C# during my summer holidays and taught myself the basics. After exploring each chapter and solving all the tasks, I participated in my first Ludum Dare and it was an amazing experience. From then on, I dove deeper into the world of computer science and eventually decided to study it.

I've also had the opportunity to work as a working student and intern in the technical development of the automobile industry. There, I was able to fully automate testing using C, C# and Python. Although I loved working with hardware, I eventually found my passion in web development and now I work as a full stack developer in a small company. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field.</p>
